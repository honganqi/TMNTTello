# TMNT Tello

The sprites in TMNT Shredder's Revenge are stored in
compressed XNB files called ZXNB. This tool allows you to
extract them into PNG files.

## Extracting PNG image files
* To get started, if you haven't set your game folder yet, 
click on the `Game Folder` button and browse to the `Content`
folder of your game installation. For example, if your game is
installed in `C:\Program Files
(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\TMNT\`, browse here and select
the `Content` folder.
* In the `Folder Browser` area, you will see a list of folders
which have ZXNB files in them. (2d, Editor, Fonts, etc.)
* Click on any folder to see all the ZXNB files in it and all
its subfolders.
* Expand it and click on any of the deeper folders to narrow
down the listed files.
* Click on an item in the `ZXNB files in folder` area to load
that image in the `Preview` area.
* To export images, you can right-click on the Preview area,
click "Export as", and browse to where you want to save the
file. You can also use the `Export` button. This requires that
you enable the `Same folder` setting or select an output folder
using the `Output Folder` button. A drag-and-drop functionality
is on the to-do list.

## Using the modded PNG images in the game
* Put the modded PNG image in the same folder where its
original ZXNB file is.
* Make sure that your PNG image file has the same name as your
original ZXNB file. For example, if you had *Leonardo.zxnb*,
rename this into *Leonardo.png*.
* Back up your original ZXNB file (e.g. Leonardo.zxnb) by
renaming it into something else (e.g. Leonardo - Copy.znxb)
so that the game doesn't see this original file anymore. The
game will ignore the PNG if a valid ZXNB file is found.

## Compressing the PNG images back into ZXNB files
* This is an optional step and is not required for you to see
your modded in the game. This function is a work-in-progress.
